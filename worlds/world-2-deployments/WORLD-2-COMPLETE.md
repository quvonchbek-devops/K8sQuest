### Deployment Management
- ✅ Rolling updates and rollback strategies
- ✅ Declarative deployment updates
- ✅ Rollout history and undo operations
- ✅ Deployment strategies (RollingUpdate, Recreate)

### Health & Readiness
- ✅ Liveness probes (detect deadlocked containers)

- ✅ Probe configuration (HTTP, TCP, Exec)
- ✅ initialDelaySeconds, periodSeconds, failureThreshold

### Scaling & Autoscaling
- ✅ HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA) configuration
- ✅ metrics-server installation and troubleshooting
- ✅ CPU/memory-based autoscaling
- ✅ Manual scaling with kubectl scale

### Update Strategies
- ✅ maxUnavailable and maxSurge parameters
- ✅ Zero-downtime deployment techniques
- ✅ Rollout strategy optimization
- ✅ Avoiding complete service outages during updates

### Availability & Maintenance
- ✅ PodDisruptionBudgets (PDB) for maintenance windows
- ✅ minAvailable vs maxUnavailable
- ✅ Node drain operations
- ✅ Balancing availability with operational flexibility

### Advanced Deployment Patterns
- ✅ Blue-green deployments (instant switchover)
- ✅ Canary deployments (gradual rollout)
- ✅ Traffic splitting and replica ratios
- ✅ Testing strategies before full rollout

### Stateful Workloads
- ✅ When to use StatefulSet vs Deployment
- ✅ Stable pod identities and network IDs
- ✅ Persistent storage for stateful apps
- ✅ Ordered startup and shutdown

### Resource Hierarchy
- ✅ Deployment → ReplicaSet → Pod abstraction
- ✅ Why to use Deployments (not ReplicaSets directly)
- ✅ Rollout management through Deployments
- ✅ Resource ownership and lifecycle

## Haqiqiy Voqea Misolis

Each level includes comprehensive real-world incident stories:

- **Level 11**: $1.2M Black Friday incident (bad deployment rollout)
- **Level 12**: $1.95M outage (liveness probe misconfiguration)
- **Level 13**: $2.8M Black Friday losses (readiness probe missing)
- **Level 14**: $3.5M game launch failure (HPA without metrics-server)
- **Level 15**: $450K SLA penalties (maxUnavailable: 100% downtime)
- **Level 16**: $250K compliance fine (PDB blocking node upgrades)
- **Level 17**: $850K CDN overages (blue-green selector not updated)
- **Level 18**: $1.2M canary exposure (50% instead of 10% traffic)
- **Level 19**: $5M+ database corruption (Deployment for stateful app)
- **Level 20**: $200K failed launch (ReplicaSet manual management)

**Total incident cost examples**: $17.2M+ in damages across all levels!

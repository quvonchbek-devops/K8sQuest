**Muammo:**
```yaml
spec:
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Delete  # ❌ Dangerous!
```
Result: When PVC deleted → PV deleted → All data permanently lost!

**Yechim:**
```yaml
spec:
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain  # ✅ Safe!
```
Result: When PVC deleted → PV marked "Released" → Data preserved

## 🔍 Tushunish Reclaim Policies

### The Three Policies

**1. Delete (Automatic Cleanup)**
```yaml
persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Delete
```
When PVC deleted:
- PV automatically deleted
- Storage released back to pool
- **All data permanently lost**

Use for: Development, test environments, ephemeral data

**2. Retain (Manual Cleanup)**
```yaml
persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
```
When PVC deleted:
- PV status → "Released"
- Data remains on disk
- Manual cleanup required
- **Data preserved**

Use for: Production, databases, critical data

**3. Recycle (Deprecated)**
```yaml
persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Recycle
```
- Runs `rm -rf` on volume
- No longer recommended
- Use Delete or Retain o'rniga

## 💥 Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Delete for Production
```yaml
# Production database
persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Delete  # ❌ Data loss risk!
```

Fix:
```yaml
persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain  # ✅ Safe
```

### Mistake 2: Not Testing Deletion
```bash
# Never tested what happens when PVC deleted
kubectl delete pvc my-data
# Oops! All data gone with Delete policy
```

### Mistake 3: Forgetting Manual Cleanup
```yaml
# Using Retain but never cleaning up Released PVs
# Eventually: Out of storage capacity
```

## 🛡️ Best Practices

1. **Use Retain for production:**
   ```yaml
   persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
   ```

2. **Document policy in annotations:**
   ```yaml
   metadata:
     annotations:
       policy-reason: "Production database - Retain required"
   ```

3. **Set in StorageClass:**
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
   kind: StorageClass
   reclaimPolicy: Retain  # Default for all PVs
   ```

4. **Process for Retain cleanup:**
   ```bash
   # 1. Tekshirish data no longer needed
   # 2. Backup if uncertain
   # 3. Delete PV manually
   kubectl delete pv my-pv
   # 4. Clean up underlying storage
   ```

5. **Monitor Released PVs:**
   ```bash
   kubectl get pv | grep Released
   # Alert if too many accumulate
   ```

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

1. **Retain = Safe** - Data preserved when PVC deleted
2. **Delete = Automatic** - Data lost when PVC deleted
3. **Use Retain for production** - Prevent accidental data loss
4. **Manual cleanup required** - With Retain policy
5. **Set in StorageClass** - For consistency
